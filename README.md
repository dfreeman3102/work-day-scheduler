# work-day-scheduler
Fifth bootcamp challenge, using what we have learned in class 
and outside research to make a work day scheduler. It must 
display the current date, have color-coded time blocks for standard working hours, 
have input boxes that save in local storage when the save button is clicked,
and display the local storage upon reloading the page.

Outside research includes watching Youtube tutorials and looking up questions on stack overflow.

Here is a screenshot of the finished project.
